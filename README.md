Flagging a person as Empathetic/Non-Empathetic by analysing narratives offered by them when asked about difficult life situations concerning other people and how they helped said people get through it. 

Project was made as an exercise in Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM). Used NLTK to sort out indivdual words and identify stopwords and Gensim was used to create word embeddings which were then analysed by 2-layer neural network of 128 LSTMs in each layer and finally prediction was done using sigmoid.
